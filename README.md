Deep 3D Similarity Metric (Deep3DSM)

Train 3D Auto-Encoder models on volumetric masks of medical image
to learn the manifold of mask shapes
and compute the distance of these shapes in the learned manifold (in latent space)
and use this distance as a similarity metric
for comparing 3D shapes and also as a cost function for training a segmentation model
